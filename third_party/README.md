Third Party Libraries
=====================
Third party libraries included with the mutgos distribution. Wherever possible, the libraries have been included in as near their original form as possible.

Any third party library added here should have a corresponding entry in this README with a description of the library, how it's used in mutgos, the version number, and any modifications that were necessary.
